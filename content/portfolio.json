      "description": "An absorbing reflection reflecting absorption of the spills. fuit.es is both a Montréal based collective and an ongoing project exploring how to collectively make online digital spaces oriented toward process as opposed to presentation. As part of their 2021 initiative Créer Des Ponts, Art Souterrain invited the fuit.es collective to build a physical extension of their website (<a href='https://fuit.es/' class='description-link'>the fuit.es digital anarchive</a>) in residency featuring the work and material practices of members of the collective. Part of that residency included a live sound performance by certain members of the collective as rollingunrolling. The piece created was a play with rollingunrolling's concept of tiny sounds, which like the fuit.es digital anarchive, tend towards the processual and generative potentials of sound to make music in their making. Techniques developed in performances and experiments such as these often make their way into the fuit.es digital space through transduction, informing and inflecting the work in the digital as a form of research.<br><br><a href='https://fuit.es/info'>https://fuit.es/info</a>",

      "description": "Tiny sound is an invented concept referring to sounds that don’t “know themselves” as opposed to something like the sound of a piano which gets heard as such. ‘Tiny sound’ is something a bit more incomplete, it’s not sure of itself yet but is already in the world; on the street, in a conversation, a film or right in the middle of a polished track. Unlike sounds such as the piano, which can differentiate themselves, tiny sound is codetermining, finding each iteration, this time, this way, in relation. This episode explores the concept of convalescence, albeit from a more material perspective as a return to things close at hand.<br><br><iframe width='100%' height='60' src='https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&mini=1&feed=%2FStillFM%2F2021-10-21-svvimming-tiny-sounds-ep-7-convalescense%2F' frameborder='0' ></iframe>",

      "description": "Minor movements are not ours to make so much as ours to attune to. To compose a minor movement is to be composed by it. The Minor Movements were a series of events held in 2019 across a number of cities in Europe and orchestrated by the Senselab, a large collective of people and hubs working at the intersection of art, philosophy and activism. A fabulatory soundscape from voices without bodies and sounds without sources was held at the Copenhagen Minor Movement in an abandoned wing of the Centre of Psychiatry that has been repurposed for artistic uses. 30 to 40 participants, including members of rollingunrolling, experimented with collective attunement to sound, composition and its compositional force.
